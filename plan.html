  <h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
  <p><strong>Name:</strong> Nusrat Jahan Nabila</p>
  
  <h2>Goal</h2>
  <p>The primary goal of the 100SMILES Dental Care website is to <strong>increase new patient bookings by 30% within six months of launch</strong> and to establish the practice as the trusted, family-friendly dental provider in the Razole community. This will be achieved by providing a clear, reassuring, and easy-to-use online presence that simplifies the process of learning about services, meeting the staff, and booking an appointment, thereby converting website visitors into patients.</p>
  
  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
  <p>Success will be measured using the following quantifiable metrics:
    <br><br>
    <strong>1. Conversion Tracking:</strong> Monitoring the number of online appointment requests submitted through the website's contact form or clicks on the "Call to Book" phone number link.
    <br><br>
    <strong>2. Promotion Uptake:</strong> Tracking the usage of the "20% discount on your first visit" offer by requiring patients to mention the "website offer" when booking.
    <br><br>
    <strong>3. User Engagement:</strong> Using analytics to measure time spent on key pages (Services, Staff), low bounce rates, and clicks on the informational articles, indicating that users are finding the site informative and trustworthy.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Target Audience</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>1. Target Audience Description:</strong><br>
    The primary target audience is <strong>families and adults aged 25-50 living in and around Razole, QLD</strong>. This group is typically responsible for their own and their children's healthcare decisions, values trust and long-term relationships with service providers, and uses the internet to research local businesses. A secondary audience is <strong>seniors and retirees</strong> in the area who may require more complex dental work and value experienced, compassionate care.
    <br><br>
    <strong>2. Intentional Design Approach:</strong><br>
    The site will be intentionally designed for this audience by:
    <br>
    - <strong>Visual Design:</strong> Using a clean, professional, and calming colour palette (e.g., blues, whites, soft greens) with high-quality images of the staff and clinic to build immediate trust and familiarity. The design will feel modern yet warm and approachable.
    <br>
    - <strong>Content & Tone:</strong> The language will be reassuring, compassionate, and free of overly complex medical jargon. It will emphasize key family-friendly values like "for all ages," "preventative care," "friendly," and "compassionate."
    <br>
    - <strong>Functionality:</strong> The site structure will be simple and intuitive, with a clear path to booking an appointment. Key information like phone numbers, trading hours, and the first-visit discount will be easy to find, catering to busy parents and those who may be anxious about dental visits.
